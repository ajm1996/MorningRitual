The game begins with the player doing his regular morning ritual-wake up, wash up, eat up, then leave. As the days go by, the ritual gets harder and harder to perform as obstacles are introduced with increasing difficulty in each level. The objective of this game is to perform the morning ritual and avoid the obstacles getting in the way.
